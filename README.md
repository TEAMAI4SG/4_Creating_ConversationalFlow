## üîΩ Steps:

1. Review lecture to get a better understanding of **intents**

2. Review lecture to get an idea of how to create your own dialog

3. For this conversational flow in **Step 4** to work, you should have a solid understanding of [special conditions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-overview#dialog-overview-special-conditions) (specifically using "true"), defining [what the chatbot should do next](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-overview#dialog-overview-jump-to-config), and [conditional responses (if statements)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-overview#dialog-overview-multiple). These concepts can be found in the ["Creating a dialogue"](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-dialog-overview) document. **!!Please read the mentioned sections in the document before getting started!!**

4. After reading the IBM documentation, you will create your own chatbot interviewer. **Please create your own assistant with the following questions in order:**

- What's your favorite movie genre (e.g.,action, comedy, or sci-fi)
- Normally, where do you watch movies?
- Where do you find out about new movies coming out?
- Have you heard of the new movie "Avengers: End Game"?
   - If the answer is positive (yes), ask: ‚ÄúWhat do you know about it?‚Äù
   - If the answer is negative (no), ask ‚ÄúWhich new movie are you looking forward to seeing?‚Äù
  
   
5. After each question, please **add a general acknowledgment message** before moving onto the next question:
- For example, the statement highlighted in blue is a general acknowledgement message: 
    - **Chatbot:** Could you introduce yourself in 2-3 sentences, especially your top talents?
    - **User:** I‚Äôm a student at San Jose State University and am currently studying management information systems. I‚Äôm really interested in learning more about AI.
    - **Chatbot:** Thank you for sharing about yourself!
    - **Chatbot:** What's your favorite movie genre (e.g.,action, comedy, or sci-fi)?
